The Cherabuddi Education Society was registered in January 1999 as an NRI-promoted society. The Society 
aims at creating a state-of-the-art engineering institution in association with leading NRI technology
professionals and well-known academicians of the twin states of Telangana & Andhra Pradesh. The Society
aims to harness technical excellence with a commitment to the ethos of 'useful learning'. 
       
Our students remain at the heart of our vision, benefiting from our innovative teaching methods, and close 
links with premier companies and research institutions in India and abroad. Students will enjoy engineering
and will have the chance to develop skills that will last a lifetime.

        Civil Engineering is as old as the Pyramids of Egypt and is the basic branch of engineering which can provide basic infrastructure such as Buildings, Highways, Railways, Airports, Dams, Bridges and Hydro power plants to any developing country. Development of infrastructure with environmental concern is considered as a measure of progress of any Country. Civil Engineering deals with the Analysis, Design, Quality control, Construction, Operational and Maintenance aspects of both natural and artificially built structures.</div>

        The Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering is one of the departments that started at the time of inception of CVR College of Engineering in 2001 with an intake of 60 B.Tech. students.  Expanding its horizons over the years, the department presently offers the B.Tech. program with an intake of 240, two M.Tech. programs with specializations in VLSI (intake 18), and Embedded Systems (intake 18), as well as Ph.D.  The department is accredited by the National Board of Accreditation.</div>
    <div class="items item4"><b>Mechanical Engineering</b><br><br>
        The Department was started in the Academic Year 2011 with an intake of 60 for the B. Tech (Mechanical Engineering) program.

        B. Tech program has been accredited by NBA for three years (2018-19 to 2020-21) under Tier-1 and got an extension for one more year (2021-22).</div>
    <div class="items item5"><b>Electrical and Electronics Engineering</b><br><br>
        Electrical and Electronics Engineering has an enormous and widespread impact on our daily lives. From power stations to electric vehicle charging, telecom networks to computing infrastructures, electronic systems in our homes, the world of entertainment and industry: all are created, designed and operated by electrical engineers. Our training equips graduates with all these skills and qualifies them to progress to rewarding careers.</div>
